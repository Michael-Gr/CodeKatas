# Due to another of his misbehaved, the primary school's teacher of the young GauÃŸ, Herr J.G. BÃ¼ttner, to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time, while he teaching arithmetic to his mates, assigned him the problem of adding up all the whole numbers from 1 through a given number n.
#
