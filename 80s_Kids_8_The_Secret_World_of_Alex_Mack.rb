# If you were born in the 80's you were probably a pre-teen when the Secret World of Alex Mack first aired. I'll be honest, the young superhero was my first crush. Typical superhero story: get slimed by radioactive gunk, obtain super powers, struggle to learn more about your powers while uncovering the truth about yourself, and most importantly, keep your identity a secret.
#
# Top executives at Paradise Valley Chemical Plant are close to finding the superhero's true identity. They know that someone who works at the plant is related to her (Shhh, it's her dad!). Danielle Atron has hired you to obtain the badge number of this person.
#
# Can you find the Secret badge number of Alex Mack's dad?
#
# Note: This is a puzzle. The initial solution is intentionally vague. Good luck!
